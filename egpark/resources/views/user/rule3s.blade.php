            <h3>Thank you for helping us keep Greenpark as a Special Gathering Place</h3>
            <p>
            We know that among many reasons, you chose Greenpark Memorial Garden for the beauty, meticulously landscaped grounds, and peacefulness it provides.
            <br>
            For this reason, and in order to preserve its consistency and harmony, we’ve set forth a list of guidelines. These will be enforced as a way to protect the safety of our visitors, the sanctity of each lot, and the beautiful gardens. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation.

                <li>All decorations are the sole responsibility of the family. Greenpark Memorial Garden is not responsible for flowers or decorations placed on a grave or mausoleum crypt.

                <li>Flowers are a lovely gift and will be left on the site or outside the mausoleum on the lawn up to two days after a funeral service. If you are planning to retrieve any floral arrangements after a funeral, we suggest you do so at the conclusion of the service.</li>
                <li>We ask that you respect the property of others.</li>
